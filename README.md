# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
As a data analyst for Pyber, a Python-based ridesharing app company, we must analyze and visualize data from their ridesharing app. Our goal is to showcase different relationships between the type of city and the number of drivers, fares, and more. For this analysis, we must create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then we must visualize it using MatPlotLib. 

## Results
There are multiple differences in ride-sharing data between the three city types: Urban, Suburban, and Rural. 

We can see that Urban cities dominate the ride count with 1625 total rides. This greatly overshadows Suburban <br>(625 rides) and Rural (125 rides) cities. The amount of drivers parallel the ride count, with Urban cities having 2405 drivers, Suburban cities having 490 drivers, and Rural cities having 78 drivers. This shows a positive correlation between population dense areas and app usage. 

The average fares show an inverse relationship with population density (total ride count). The average fares in Urban areas are the lowest at $24.53. Suburban areas reign in at number two with an average fare of $30.97. The highest average fare is in Rural areas at $34.62. Our analysts suspect that this is due to the longer ride distance in lower population density areas.
